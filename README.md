# Arch Dotfiles
Welcome! This is a backup of my dotfiles, which you can also use to get a little jumpstart in ricing i3!

## Three Bars

## Full Bar

# Important Notes
Do NOT expect these dotfiles to work the first time. They may require some slight tweaks to fit your needs.
For example, the polybar will not be aligned on a screen bigger/smaller than 1920x1080.
The wallpapers may not be immediately available because they contain copyrighted material.
They will be available on another webpage in the future.

# How to use
This is meant to be run after the system and apps are installed. You can run setmeup.sh (make executable!) to make the symbolic links instantly.
