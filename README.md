# Arch Dotfiles
Welcome! This is a backup of my dotfiles, which you can also use to get a little jumpstart in ricing i3!

# System Info
- Framework Laptop 13 (13th Gen Intel i5)
- Intel Core i5-1340P
- 32GB DDR4-3200
- 1TB WD Black SN770

# Notice
Please do not expect the dotfiles to work first time on your system.
Because everyone has a slightly different computer, tweaks are needed to get these dotfiles to work on your system.

# How to use
This is meant to be run after the system and apps are installed.
You can run setmeup.sh (make executable!) to make the symbolic links instantly.
