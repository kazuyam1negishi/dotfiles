# Arch Dotfiles
Welcome! This is a backup of my dotfiles, which you can also use to get a little jumpstart in ricing i3!

# Images being updated

# Important Notes
Do NOT expect these dotfiles to work the first time. They may require some slight tweaks to work on your system.
For example, the polybars have their offsets set for a 1920x1080 monitor. 

# How to use
This is meant to be run after the system and apps are installed. You can run setmeup.sh (make executable!) to make the symbolic links instantly.
